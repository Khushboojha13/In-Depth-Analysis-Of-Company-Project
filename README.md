Project Overview
Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains valuable information related to the company's sales and profit figures, categorized by market segments and country/region. These insights are crucial for understanding the company's performance, identifying growth opportunities, and making data-driven decisions.

Objectives
Perform extensive data pre-processing to ensure data quality. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights. Visualize sales and profit trends over time to identify patterns. Provide recommendations and key takeaways based on the analysis.

Pre-processing Tips
Before diving into the analysis, it's essential to preprocess the dataset for accurate results. Here are some tips for effective pre-processing:

Check for Column Names: Begin by inspecting the column names. Ensure that column names are correctly formatted, and there are no errors or inconsistencies.

Remove Special Characters: Remove any special characters like "$" or "-" from the dataset. These characters can hinder numerical operations.

Change Data Types: Convert columns from object data types to integers or floats, as needed, to perform mathematical operations and create meaningful visualizations.

Challenge: Remove Commas: Challenge yourself to eliminate commas from numerical values. Commas can cause data type issues and must be removed to treat numbers as numbers.

Exploratory Data Analysis
One of the project's highlights is the exploratory data analysis (EDA). We'll visualize sales and profit trends over time, which will provide valuable insights into the company's performance. This analysis will help uncover patterns, identify areas of improvement, and support data-driven decision-making.
